 üéì Medical Admission Predictor (Demo)

This repository provides a **demo version** of a machine learning model that predicts university admission outcomes for candidates in the **Konkur (Iranian university entrance exam, Experimental stream)**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This demo uses a small synthetic dataset (30 samples).  
The real dataset and advanced preprocessing steps are private.  
On the real dataset, the model achieves around **90‚Äì93% accuracy**.

You can install them easily:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


How to Run
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/mrz-agri/demo_v1.0_medical-admission-predictor.git
cd demo_v1.0_medical-admission-predictor


Run the demo script:
python demo2_uniadmission


This will:

Print accuracy scores and a classification report in the terminal

Generate an animated GIF (rf_cv_demo.gif) that shows probability predictions


Example Output

Accuracy on demo dataset: 100% (‚ö†Ô∏è synthetic dataset, very small)

Accuracy on real dataset: 90‚Äì93% (private)

Output includes:

Per-fold accuracy scores

Classification report

Animated GIF


Note on Privacy

The full dataset and complete preprocessing code are kept private due to sensitivity and confidentiality.
